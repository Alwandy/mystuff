# Upload some of my stuff here that I mess in different languages like C#, Java, SQF, Python etc
This GIT is dedicated to stuff I do day to day, including work and non work related. 
Though work related will be modified to standard examples for public usage e.g no work content there, just the functionality or idea. 


# Check my work out
Each work I done have been added in branches, feel free to check them per branch.
