UKSF Website

# Project
This project is for a community I deal with, our website needed to be upgraded and more functional than the current one I made with Laravel (http://uk-sf.com) so we decided to utilize NodeJS as backend and Angular as front end so few others could contribute to changes when I was unable to do so due of time.
